logical time is a generalization of physical, clock time to fit alternative structures of causality.
the assumption being that 'what caused what to happen' is a more important fact than 'what happened first in physical clock time.'
i use it because it makes it easier to work with predictions about the future- usually predictions about what other people will do, so that i can adjust my actions accordingly. if i know how you will behave- if i can use logic to accurately deduce the behavior you will display in specific circumstances, and you do not do the same for me- then i am in some sense *causally* ahead of you. your future actions have affected my actions here in the present, even though our physical clock times are the same.

originally from distributed computing.

elaboration [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dKAJqBDZRMMsaaYo5/in-logical-time-all-games-are-iterated-games), though used in a context i don't usually find myself talking about.
