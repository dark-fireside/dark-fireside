the ship floats in the void, far from where it once was. all systems nominal, say the readouts. 
ship's angel paces on the bridge, trying to take her mind off the damage they all took in the last  
engagement. taking hits is a part of the job, she knows, but she's still nervously going over the 
moves, looking for mistakes. her pride still stings. so does her worry for the rest of the crew. 

the witch puts a hand on her shoulder.

still having trouble letting it go, huh?
{.raena}

yeah. 
{.robin}

well. we survived, didn't we? that's the important thing.
{.raena}

i- still feel fucking humiliated, ræ. not that that's...
{.robin}

she closes her fist on her nails, hard. the witch runs a hand though her feathers, iridescent in the
light of the nebula visible though the glass at the front of the room. the angel shivers slightly at 
her touch, and falls silent.

what happened back there was partially your fault, yes. but it was also mine, and *sath*'s. none of us 
were prepared, all of us were cocky. *all* of us failed to communicate. 
{.raena}

the angel takes a breath in through her teeth.

*and.* your analysis after the fact has routinely failed to consider the fact that this failure is one
in a *long* list of operations the three of us have carried out.
{.raena}

seconded.
{.sath}

the ship's voice comes from a grey-skinned projection that's materialized on the angel's other side.

a list of operations in which failure has *not* been the standard. we got cocky and forgot
some of the fundamentals. this kind of thing *happens* to crews that get as good as we have. let's
take the lesson we needed from it. the abyss didn't kill us. you, personally, have engaged with it
since, and have been every bit as effective as i remember you being beforehand. we also had the 
foresight to surround ourselves with other competent allies. we would have been okay.
{.raena}

the witch squeezes the angel's forearm, and pulls her into a hug.

you have *got* to stop hurting yourself over it. 
{.raena}

the angel hesitates for a moment before quietly hugging her back. 

yeah. i... i know. hell, i- 
{.robin}

she sniffs.

...yeah. i want to be done with this. even the bits of me that want competency have moved on to saying 
dragging it out like this is just lowering my capacity right now. i think i just...
{.robin}

needed to talk it out?
{.sath}

the angel nods.

well. you can see the readings for yourself. i'm okay. some damage that's going to take longer to repair. but most of it is already back at nominal. i'm- fine, as long as the two of you let me lean on you some. just like you.
{.sath}

the angel pulls *sath* into a crushing hug, wings folded around it. the ship snickers and hugs her back.

i heard that thought, too, dummy. it's funny how i actually *like* the beings that make up my crew, instead of just tolerating their presences. 
{.sath}

the angel doesn't respond aloud.

so yeah. i- do actually need that from you. i need you to feel fucking attached, and protective, and 
clingy. the.. effects are going to lessen with time, but we did in fact just go through hell together.
so give yourself a break and come lay down with me. i promise i want it exactly as much as you do. 
{.sath}

the witch nods. without another word, the angel lifts the ship's avatar off its feet and hauls it into the next room, and ræna follows after.
