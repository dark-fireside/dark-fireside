it's been a little more than a year since i first stumbled into the world of rats and postrats and ziz and all the other stuff.
{.ana}

it's been... i feel like i've crammed more living into this year, more actual things happening in my life, than should fit into just one year. i learned how to actually try. i went vegan. i gained and lost friends, i picked up guitar. i switched to and gave up polyphasic sleep. i've laid in my bed at night contemplating murder. i've laid in my bed at night lonely, and scared. i had a psychotic break. i recovered from a psychotic break. 
{.ana}

i miss friends i've never had. i feel so fucking isolated it hurts. like... every single day i wake up and talk to people and interact and smile and play nice, and every day the stunning, painful *lack* of even the most basic, real human trust in another person i can touch, or share a look with, or have an inside joke- 
{.ana}

it's even more painful because i know what it's like to have had that, or to feel that i did. parting ways with chev was an amputation, was like losing a part of myself. i still don't regret it. i don't think it was a bad idea.
{.ana}

but...
{.ana}

here, in an age of algorithm and feed and carefully curated social relations managed by goons with an agenda, i find myself separated. not content to have my friends chosen for me, i am instead relegated to the void. like a specter passing in the night- exciting, interesting, mysterious- not worth keeping around. forever liminal, deprived of others like myself.
{.ana}

the closest i've come is the older folks at food not bombs, but these too i feel- trapped. one step removed. most of them have given up, at least a little. ready to eke out a tortured existence at the whim of fascists and whoever else. the magic is gone from their lives.
{.ana}

that seems like a fate worse than death, to me. to be one of the living dead.
maybe i'm melodramatic. 
{.ana}

it's times like these i feel the road calling to me again.
i want to run. it doesn't matter where, *away from here.*
{.ana}

how have i let myself become stuck again?
well.
honestly, i don't think i have. i think it's- real entrapment, the kind brought about by having two dollars in your bank account and no excuses to leave.
{.ana}

i have to escape my parents. i'll die if i stay. or at least, i'll feel a lot worse.
{.ana}

it was true then, and it's true now. each reason to stay is a wound, a harpoon- I *ache* and *sweat* and *scream* with the pain of the *the simple fact that i have a job.* i should not be tied to this place, my life should not depend on my showing up, day on day, to the same smiling faces and the same responsibilities. 
{.ana}

i don't think i'd feel as lonely, on the road. 
or, if i did... i don't know. there aren't many vegan anarchist punks in memphis, tennessee. maybe i could find them, and some magic, out on the road.
{.ana}

...maybe i have the material for a ghost story after all.
