the witch and the angel are sitting together in *sath*'s workshop. the angel is keeping its hands busy, various tools strewn within easy reach. one hand busy with the task of opening the interface port embedded in the side of her neck. the other tapping a rhythm into the flesh of its thigh as she listens to the witch talk.

i just... i hate when we make a-

she makes a noise of exasperation.

i hate when we make an effort, sacrifice a lot of piece of mind to show up somewhere, sacrifice time we could spend catching up on the things we have to do, and- and there wasn't any reason for us to be there! neither of them seemed even the least bit invested, or at least-

the angel reaches over to give her hand a brief squeeze. she sighs, and puts her head down on the desk.

yeah, no. i feel that. it's- frustrating too, cause i know there was a chance of it *not* sucking. we keep trying to come back cause we know there's a shot for it to work.

the witch groans, a kind of pained agreement. the angel gets its port open, plugs in an adapter and then a wire to its terminal, typing with one hand and running the other though the witch's hair.

...can we just leave next time? can we just- say that we're bored and go? please?

the angel nods, and leans against the witch's shoulder. a shudder passes through her body, and she curls into the angel's side, fingers automatically finding the contacts embedded under the angel's second pair of shoulder blades, each with its counterpart in the tip of one of its witch's fingers. handshake. a twin pair of gasps. 

a small smirk crosses the angel's face, and it pulls ræna securely against itself, and returns to its work.
