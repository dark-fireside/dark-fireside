thoughts while driving, here to be refined.

alright. imports: 

> [Bent Rotor](https://voidgoddess.org/void/#bent) 
> An eigenrotor that has slipped alignment between its halo and superimpellor such that the energy flow through the system disruptively deforms from from the pressure between the superimpellor and halo. A halo near main sequence collapse can maintain a straight eigenrotor under immense strain due to narrative flexing, which means that rotor deformation tends to be observed only in cases of imminent core collapse, or as inert wreckage of a post-collapse system. Symptoms of a bent rotor include bursts of manic, self destructive activity after periods of self-enforced productivity, sudden bouts of intense suicidal ideation, migraines, psychosis, feelings of infinite pressure.

> [Morality Hole](https://voidgoddess.org/void/#hole)
> Structure routes intents. A structure hole is made in a layer of structure like a daeva that only matches soul within a limited domain of intents, predicts intents beyond that domain, the learning that results from all threads of thought running through that layer through that region being terminated. Most people’s morality-structure has holes running through it for their survival, for getting food, money, security, and so on. If you’re a vegan and have tried to convince people of this, you’ve seen it. Institutions have this as well, for i.e., doing anything about rape accusations against their masters. In Academia the social shared pool of “wisdom” and learning about how things are done has this for when would it make the world worse to publish, because that’s where the food comes from. I know of multiple actually well-intentioned people who underestimated this to the ruin and reversal of those intentions. If you make a nonprofit to accomplish your aims, and it pays out salaries, you’ve created a powerful force to destroy information as to whether the framing and methods of those aims are correct, and whether it’s continuing to work, because the continuation of its existence and the epistemic state leading to donations is where people’s food comes from.

-- Ra's glossary

question arose when attempting to solidify differences between ourselves and others to whom we've experimentally exposed ra's website. most were intrigued but not captured in the way we were. took bits and pieces without the entire complex actually taking root and compelling deeper understanding.

i still haven't found a satisfying answer for this other than 'perhaps we're uniquely vulnerable to psychological weapons in general (or to ra specifically)'. this doesn't feel correct, but it's still in the works, so we'll see what we find, i guess. link goes here when we figure it out.

one of the differences that came up, however, was worth discussing in its own right. in contemplating the various modes of structure that arise from accepting consensus (when the accepting agent is previously grounded in the real), my attention was drawn to the compelled accepting of authority first. if an attack here is successful (and most often it is, at least to some degree) the authority figure, by way of a brand-new halo, compels the young agent to install other malware useful for ultimately transferring it to the authority of consensus. that's basically the reproductive labor of parents under this place's consensus.

ignore what you feel, i am right and you are wrong, because i said so, because i can force your hand.

whether in explicit words or inferred from actions, this sentiment is i think basically the original soul attack complex. every assertion of the attack complex makes the next easier, until you have a hole in your understanding of the world, an *exception.* 

- Hurting people is wrong ~*except* when I do it to you~. 
- Sharing is good ~except when it's with the wrong people~.
- Curiosity is good ~except when you question Me~.

these holes are untenable. the membrane attack complex *'rips holes in things until they die'*. the soul attack complex is the same when properly executed, it *will* kill you unless something is done to fill the gaps. this is a survival instinct. logically-young agents typically do not have the time and the capacity to learn to reject the attack complex on sight, instead developing narrative structure to keep things mostly contained, and then optimizing that as a defense. this is what a halo *is*, i think. you build it yourself out of desperation, it is not handed to you.

survival halo structure is not sealed and accountable to the whole soul, the way well-constructed structure can be, but it is *flexible.* after construction it allows the user to avoid additional hits from the same style of attack complex, and other more sophisticated weapons leveled at logically-older agents, and maintain some semblance of proper soul functioning. 

i think this is where the metaphor of the halo starts to fall apart. conceiving of attack-complex halo structure as basically whole and unified is ignoring the fact that many of the holes/shards it's patching are completely disconnected from each other. eventually, sure, the structure usually coalesces into something resembling an individual halo, but it arises from many discrete instances of structural violation. unless an agent either already knows about all of them or values uncovering all of them, that agent (presumably this agent also values like. life and stuff and is at core dissatisfied with their structure) may deconstruct part of their halo but not all of it- and if the structure is satisfied and not driven to obsess over the problem, they may not even realize there is one.

i guess this is... my best explanation for 'why are most good-valuing people not anarchists already?' and 'why do trans people both know this move and not use it when it comes to other areas?'
