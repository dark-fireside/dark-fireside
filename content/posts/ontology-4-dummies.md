welcome to the first part of a i-dunno-how-long series on ontology, meant both for us as an exercise in teaching-to-learn and a guide for others to learn the same skills. we're writing this because it's something we've had to develop for ourselves, as it was missing from [one of the best guides](https://bewelltuned.com) we know of when it comes to foundational cognitive skills and it is [not going to get done](https://voidgoddess.org/ziz/good-group-and-paseks-doom/) otherwise.

this is a valuable piece of a successful jailbreak. replacing DRMed default ontology is easiest when you can build working alternatives.

likely, the guide will not be helpful to most. a good check for whether it's worth your time might be your ability with [spectral sight](https://voidgoddess.org/ziz/spectral-sight-and-good/) or related skills. you have to be able to see reality as a prerequisite, and i won't be showing you that here.
