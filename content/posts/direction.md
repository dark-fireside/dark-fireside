robin: alright so now that we've firmly established ourselves as someone who doesn't know what the fuck we're talking about, i would like to pause for a moment to consider the overall direction of the blog. so far, we're mostly just trying to figure out what we actually want to do in this space. that's kind of going to be a messy process, but we think we're going to end up somewhere interesting, at least.
we like to [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ) (bonus points if that link tells you anything about our history of using note-taking applications lmao). we also have pretty strong feelings about intellectual honesty and making the way our thoughts and philosophies have changed and grown over time as obvious as possible. (when reasonable. if something we post does or causes harm it's going down.) i fully expect us to discover and/or completely change our mind about specific parts of our framework if we find something that works better.
