Epistemic status: reasoning about particular hangups that have been bugging us for about two years now. not sure if the source of our discrepancy applies to many or if it's a product of the way people talk about veganism online. feel free to slam dunk us into the sun about this one, i need to know if this is the result of a fault in our assumptions or reasoning somewhere. further reading would also be appreciated.

UPDATE:

> i think this was a mistake to post, and so we're going to take it down. bad praxis, plus we can reason through the questions we want answered ourselves. contact us if you want the text.
