Epistemic status: reasoning about particular hangups that have been bugging us for about two years now. not sure if the source of our discrepancy applies to many or if it's a product of the way people talk about veganism online. feel free to slam dunk us into the sun about this one, i need to know if this is the result of a fault in our assumptions or reasoning somewhere. further reading would also be appreciated.

..not particularly sure how to start this one. You can sort of track into it via the internal conflict we've had about the eggs taken from backyard chickens. In particular, the way we're trying to reason through whether or not eating them is actually consistent with our values.

> Hi! Quick warning. Don't this post as a self-defeating argument to do nothing about your complicity in violence against other creatures. That is behavior we consider worthy of the same punt into the sun.

A quick search for 'veganism backyard eggs' on ddg yields a slew of articles from various vegan publications, which list several considerations. We've taken the liberty of summarizing them below, but you can find [two](https://www.befairbevegan.com/why-vegan/the-animals-we-use/backyard-eggs/) [examples](https://theminimalistvegan.com/backyard-eggs/) right here if you want to check them out yourself.

1. backyard eggs are typically extracted in a way that causes harm to chickens. egg production at the speeds of modern barnyard chickens is a strain on their reproductive systems and can deplete them of nutrients and cause them pain.
2. backyard chickens themselves are typically the products of generations of violence and harm.
3. most people who keep backyard chickens kill any roosters among the flock.
4. chickens are not free to move around at their will, and are kept caged by humans.

One thing to note: many of these publications can't seem to figure out the difference between commercially-available chicken eggs that purport to be 'free range' and 'ethical' (while in reality still mostly being products created/stolen by the incentives of industrial farming and all the violence that entails), and chicken eggs you or your neighbor has available because you keep chickens in the backyard. (Not that that can't also be an evil system! We've seen examples of such ourselves.)
I have attempted to isolate the arguments that actually apply to backyard chickens here.

They tend to point to this thesis:
> The nature of the relationship between chickens and humans is exploitative and extractionary. Consuming eggs from this system is a commitment to perpetuating it. All chickens currently alive today are a product of this system, and even the ones who make it to be raised outside of a factory farm are subjected to intense torture and trauma. Therefor consuming eggs, even from backyard chickens, is immoral.

There are several differences in where the focus of the argument lies- one article makes mention of chickens rescued from industrial farms, for example, while others do not. But broadly speaking they all point to this line of logic with a pretty big assumption hidden in it. (This is the part where I start drawing my conclusions, and the part where readers should interrogate my logic. please.)
The articles all seem to have baked-in the assumption that *any* relationship with an animal that involves a transfer of something material from one to the other is, inherently, exploitation. And that's a fair assumption! The way things are set up now, collecting eggs in the way unconcerned backyard farmers do is essentially stealing. But that line of logic forbids any other relationship from existing- like can't even conceive a situation in which a human receives an egg from a chicken and is not stealing it.

This is not me trying to use a happy meat fallacy. But if the exploitation, specisim, and domination are what we're fighting against... most of these articles just read like "things to do if you want to treat chickens in your care well." 

And even still this argument kinda sounds bad faith, even to our ears! "What about a hypothetical scenario that exists maybe sometime in the future, when humans stop being fucking assholes?" I don't really think this is a hypothetical, though. I've lived with several people who keep chickens and one of these was absolutely doing a fantastic job. Most of the flock voluntarily remained in the area she prepared for them- a huge yard with wildflowers and grass and trees and things. There was nominally a gate separating it from the rest of the world, but in practice all of the chickens could jump over or go under the thing. They had an automatic door to keep out predators in the coop. It was pretty cool. The rooster was kinda shy but pretty friendly, and several of the hens would jump onto your lap for affection. Most of the hens only laid once every three or four days, and just kinda left the eggs unless they were brooding. They didn't seem like they were paying rent in eggs. It kinda just seemed like they didn't care if she took them. She gave them back the shells, and left the rotting ones in the field.
And that relationship seems- a little more like a division of labor and less like resource extraction to me, I guess. Those are eggs I didn't really feel guilty about eating, and still don't. 

Now maybe this doesn't get spoken about because it's bad praxis. I kinda get that. I prefaced this for a reason- it's easier to say "all animal products are deontologically bad, normie. we live in an oppressive machine" and move on with your life. Cause the people who can figure things out are going to anyway, and the folks who were gonna be on the fence will take every chance to 5&10 themselves into oblivion. hell, maybe that's what i'm doing now. (i'd like to think i'm pretty good at this whole introspection thing by this point, but there's always a chance i'm full of it i guess.)
but i dunno. i want to define my ideology on its own terms, and not have to bootstrap via photonegative carnism, i guess. conceive of something without domination as a reference point.
