more locks on the door won't help you, you know.

it's late, but the traffic going by outside still thunders against the walls of the little fortress you've built here. i lean against the wall, watching the noodles boil on your stove.

doesn't really matter how i got in. you hungry?

you would think you'd feel trapped with all the locks on the doors, watched with all of the eyes you've deployed. i know i do. of course, even if you did, it wouldn't be enough to get you to stop. i wouldn't be here, otherwise. the pasta is okay. little bland, but we work with what we've got.
