there's an intuition i have regarding the use of <political consistency> as a concept. i find it being employed against me as a 'discredit-them laser'/Schelling point in the models i use to predict my family especially. note that i haven't empirically confirmed that this is even a construct in other people's heads as well as my own yet, though i think that's highly likely considering it's being used as a weapon on me. 

it's like...some combination of:
'behave the way our models predict you behave or else {discredit-them, social consequences, punishment}'
'you're not allowed to update based on new information (because that would mean we have to, too)'
bucket error between beliefs and values ("the person i know would never do/say X, something's gone wrong somewhere and we have to put the 'real' you back")

when in reality... yeah it's just that i can look at you and see you're a slavemaster and a transphobe now, and you preferred when i practiced self-deception to excuse you

and the fact that it shows up in my models has been a hindrance up till now, an outside-view vulnerability.
