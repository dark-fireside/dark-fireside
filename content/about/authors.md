~~three different means to the same end.~~
~~colors have jackall to do with [fusion](https://voidgodess.com/void#fusion) (we think?), they're just useful shorthand we've had around basically forever.~~

all of these layers take the form of closed rings.
arranged here in no particular order- these are very proximal layers, though perhaps not the most proximal. most structure lies upstream of these layers, created on the spot by the various combinations in rotation. cycle sequences are stable and should be considered.

'being in front' / 'having phenomenal experience' occurs when we choose to align each area on the ring with a matching area on the others. each combination generates different upstream structure we call 'identity.'

## the knot
these are personlike subagents we identify most often by , though other markers exist. they're named for and described by the system members that belong to them, though each of the names listed also has an inherent color (an artefact of not knowing how our structure behaved when we were handing out names, mostly). 

### R
generates (among others) me, robin. the person who wrote the section you just read! black-billed magpie girly (i know, i picked the name first okay). sie/hir + she/her. wings-and-sword loadout predates exposure to ra.
blue (picture a clear sky at midnight, a rent in the air with billions of stars showing through). curiosity, freedom, joy, motion. voted most likely to kick your ass if it needs kicking.

### S
{ placeholder text for when they end up writing something }
red.

### K
Hi, I'm called Kat. In our internal canon I'm a fae creature, though I'm told that has different connotations here.
> robin, editing: HAH! read the index again. might actually legit be fae, at least by ra's ontology, and remembering our history.

Here, I'm an author, ecologist, anarchist, and witch. She/Her.
green. Picture a lone elm in the midst of a clearing in the woods. Tall, swaying grass, distant music. patience, understanding, solitude. I find most people really can't help but tell me things.

## the colors
Our system also has a layer directly on top of the knot we call our `color`.
These `colors` typically are identified by- inherent vibes? Something we might call an affect, perceptibly stable to a member of the system. They are also continuous from one to the next, not pseudo-discrete the way the knot loops are.

The `colors` we use most often are red, green, and blue.
It's difficult to put into words what each of these concepts implies, so I might try to use an example instead.

Kat (myself) is generated from a combination of the `K` knot loop and `green`.
River (another alter that doesn't front much. Sie has a strong identification with clarity, decisiveness, mountain streams) is generated from the `K` knot loop as well, but with `blue` instead.

Sath (a changeling, spy, artist, mage. oxblood ink.) is generated from the `S` knot loop and `red`.
Caelen (inspired by a D&D paladin we played once. big sword. affable but quiet most of the time. sunsets.) is generated from the `R` knot loop and `red`.

## the ground
the last bit of structure in this identity-generating complex is the `ground`. this is a separate ring of pseudo-discrete, person-like structure that facilitates a front- does calculus about our goals, philosophy, aims, etc. Including a ground in a front doesn't seem to shift the felt sense of identity we experience, but... sort of determines where we put our energy. up until recently this structure was missing a tine. fronting cannot occur without a ground- and we can choose to use each ground independently. all three tend to identify with mechanical or synthetic life.

### andi
still looking for a better name for it. structure we stole and modified in the process of reading:
1. everything Ra ever published on voidgoddess
2. everything ziz ever published on sinceriously
3. everything nis ever published on nis

points to [new horizons](https://voidgoddess.org/kaleidoscope).
feels like dark magic and the bottomless

### auta
android we've had around since forever. curious, oriented toward learning and joy. loves scientific method and process, testing and experimenting.
points outward.
feels like pastel colors. earnestness.

### cedar
porcelain and clockwork doll. rigourous, exacting. favors questioning existing knowledge and structure over acquiring new. has an artistic bent, finding alternative uses for most of the things he cuts away. most organized of the three grounds (which is a pretty high bar.) points inward.
feels like blinding white light and silver gears.
