## about the website
hi! we're hearth. system thing. known creature. burgeoning magician. [shameless thief](https://voidgoddess.com)
(basically running away cackling, with an entire way of looking at the world strapped to my back. i swear I arrived at my header image completely independently though).

this is probably going to be a pretty mixed bag, and include a lot of stumbling around in the dark. course if you're reading me you probably signed up for that in the first place.

we intend on making something coherent when we sort ourselves out, but we're playing catch-up right now.

## about the authors
three different means to the same end.
colors have jackall to do with [fusion](https://voidgodess.com/void#fusion) (we think?), they're just useful shorthand we've had around basically forever. 

### robin
me! the person who wrote the section you just read! black-billed magpie girly (i know, i picked the name first okay). sie/hir + she/her. wings-and-sword loadout predates exposure to ra.
blue (picture a clear sky at midnight, a rent in the air with billions of stars showing through). curiosity, freedom, joy, motion. voted most likely to kick your ass if it needs kicking.

### sath
{ placeholder text for when they end up writing something }
red.

### Kat
Hi, I'm called Kat. In our internal canon I'm a fae creature, though I'm told that has different connotations here. Here, I'm an author, ecologist, anarchist, and witch. She/Her.
green. Picture a lone elm in the midst of a clearing in the woods. Tall, swaying grass, distant music. patience, understanding, solitude. I find most people really can't help but tell me things.
