current targets:

~~- find a way to incorporate fictive learning into our process. procedures? thought experiments?~~
    ~~- how to do that instinctively? who would be good at it? might just be a piece of grounding in the void~~
    - you were sort-of right. run the fucking sim.
- scrape together enough income to kick off some kind of feedback loop for the cule. need to get out of the state.
    - you can help, dear reader! support us on [our ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/darkfireside)!
