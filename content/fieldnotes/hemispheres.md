hemisphere theory taken from ziz.

## sleep
accidentally discovered unihemispheric sleep while attempting to wake-induce a lucid dream.

## seperation
pretty sure hemispheres cry independently- chirality isn't reversed for this though
revealed as a consequence of accidentally discovering unihemispheric sleep, though we're pretty sure this applies to daily life too

rh does not remember the dream it was crying about. will attempt to discover when we both end up lucid.
