## state of mind

both times we've purposefully accessed a WILD so far have been from a state of purposeful accord among the three of us, with <for-what?> clearly in mind.

> update: have accessed *many* more than two times at this point, this kind of intense purposefulness *helps* but has not proven to be strictly necessary

seems *wildly* easier to access them from an alert-calm state, too. second success we've had since the first-try was after spending the evening (about two hours) doing other mental-config type play.


## breathing

as an obstacle, i think right now breathing regulation is the one we need to focus on. not in a 'i must remain conscious and in control of my breath' way, but in a 'this has to be normal so i don't get exited and break the state' way. which i think might just come from getting the state multiple times on command.


## stabilization
still working on this. current techniques i'm trying are grounding through senses, narrative tricks ('ACME lucidity pills'), and normalizing the state itself.
