## ghouls
i think i instinctively feel more afraid of ghouls than i do of eg. vampires. not like... abstractly, i think vampires as a class are *much* more deadly than ghouls, but to a younger version of myself the *idea* of ghouls was frightening. agentic malice was easier to conceptualize as ultimately derivative of mustache-twirling villains, but stupidity with the same structure was just painful to imagine. (i'm sure that has *nothing* to do whatsoever with my parent's undead types. /s.)

## liches
"surely if they run on hope they have to being doing *something* good, right? right??"

actually no. sorry. you can put hope in an empire. or a god.

my attempt to build a halo when i was 12-ish collapsed because it's just... genuinely not necessary for my existence. 

- eric winestine? seems unresolved right up until the point the empire is dead. "oh no, the state is like. for important stuff, you can't question the powers that be too deeply else risk collapse!" 

> edit: no, nvm. he's definitely a vamp. ugh. could have just gone with initial impression on that one.
